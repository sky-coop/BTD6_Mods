This mod needs a rounds.json file in XX\BloonsTD6\Mods\DIY Rounds\ folder to work.
If you want to use the mod ASAP, You can copy the default [DIY Rounds] folder (in the source code folder) in to that position.

But it's highly recommanded to let your EDITOR to find your game path, then you could save file to game folder with ease. 
In addition, you can choose to auto save your change to game once you have done some operation, the game will load the new file ASAP.
